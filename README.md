# Dota Hero Analysis

### Project outliners:
 1. fetch data from opendota.api
 2. **pipeline/** will handle it
 3. **process/** will process it xd
 4. **dashboard/** use streamlit for 0 effort dashboarding

### Goal
is to get average hdpm(hero damage per min) and tdpm(tower damage per min) for each hero and use that data to predict win rate of a match based on the combined
hdpm and tdpm of the team. the hunch here higher ccombined hdpm and tdpm should lead to a win.
